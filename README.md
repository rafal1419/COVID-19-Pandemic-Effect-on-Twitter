This is a study that aimed to identify the main negative topics posted by Twitter users during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the project objective is understanding the impact of the pandemic on community concerns. 
<br />Furthermore, we identified the problematic topic by doing a topic modeling on negative sentiment part of the analyzed tweets.<br />
### Methods:
1- First, Our goal was to collect tweets written in English in specific countries (e.g.: United States of America(USA), United Kingdom(UK), Canada)  
2- We marked three different periods(before the lockdown from 14-1-2020 to 29-2-2020, during the lockdown of each country, and after the lockdown from 1-6-2020 to 15-7-2020) to know the topic trend of negative tweets and how they change during these periods.
